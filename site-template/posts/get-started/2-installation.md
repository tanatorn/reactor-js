title: Installation
---

To install Reactor.js run the command `npm install -g reactor-js`

To initialize a directory, run `reactor init myStaticSite && cd myStaticSite`

Next, we can run a local server to do our editing by running
`reactor serve` in the root of the folder

Now the server should be served on `http://localhost:8080`

To generate the static files, run `reactor build`, the files should be generated in your `./site` folder
