The rhetoric said in the beginning of every Arrow episode is somewhat interesting.

1. _Season One_:
  ```
  "My name is Oliver Queen. For five years I was stranded on an island with only one goal: survive. Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish. To use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become... something else"
  ```
2. _Season Two_
  ```
  "My name is Oliver Queen. After five years on a hellish island, I have come home with only one goal: to save my city. But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was. To honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else. I must be... something else"
  ```
